<i>Get them!</i>

3
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,449
<i>Don't let them get away.</i>

4
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:17,079
<i>That way.</i>

5
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,628
<i>Get them!</i>

6
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:26,213
<i>Get them all!</i>

7
00:01:29,466 --> 00:01:31,009
<i>Get them all!</i>

8
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:33,887
<i>Over there.</i>

9
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,690
Father!

10
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:38,577
Look at me, son.

11
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:42,414
Are you afraid? Answer me!

12
00:02:43,165 --> 00:02:44,458
Yes, sir. I am.

13
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:49,504
The only way to conquer fear
is to face it head-on.

14
00:02:50,088 --> 00:02:51,882
Father.

15
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:03,685
His name is Kim Mu-Seon.
He lives in Gaeseong.

16
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:07,272
I'm staying with you.

17
00:03:07,356 --> 00:03:08,607
Father.

18
00:03:08,732 --> 00:03:12,444
Father.

19
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:17,282
From this moment, you're her father.

20
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:20,369
Look after her to the end.

21
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,496
Have you got that?

22
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:26,958
- Yes, sir.
- Get up.

23
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:49,898
Father!

24
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,817
Go, my children!

25
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,944
Find the traitor!

26
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,322
Father, no!

27
00:03:57,406 --> 00:03:58,865
Father!

28
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,541
Don't let them get away.

29
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:14,756
Come on.

30
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,092
Hurry.

31
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:21,930
We must go.

32
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:25,225
Father!

33
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:26,351
Over there!

34
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,946
I'm going back.

35
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:39,030
Please, Ja-In.

36
00:04:39,114 --> 00:04:44,411
He's fighting them.
We must bring him his bow.

37
00:04:44,494 --> 00:04:48,123
He told me to look after it.
Don't you understand?

38
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:51,126
I'm going back. Let me go!

39
00:04:52,878 --> 00:04:57,883
Let's go back to him. He needs his bow.

40
00:04:57,966 --> 00:05:00,635
Nam-Yi, please.

41
00:05:26,495 --> 00:05:31,875
We got the traitor. Find his children.

00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:41,134
<i>Director: KIM Han-min</i>

43
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:11,706

44
00:06:19,506 --> 00:06:21,049
Nam-vi!

45
00:06:28,765 --> 00:06:30,225
Nam-vi!

49
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:07,262
Did you witness his death?

50
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,981
You must be Ja-In.

51
00:07:24,446 --> 00:07:28,450
What were his final words?

52
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:37,250
Those ignorant of diplomacy
enthrone a new king.

53
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:41,963
Alas, the destiny of the nation
hangs by a thread!

54
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:45,383
Take care of this bow
until my child has grown.

55
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:54,976
The hand that supports the bow
should be strong like the great mountain.

56
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,937
The hand that draws the bow
should be fast like a tiger.

57
00:08:16,247 --> 00:08:20,502
Have Lady Kim prepare
fresh clothes for them.

58
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:22,128
Yes Sir!

59
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:16,057
Get changed. Don't go wandering about.

60
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:24,816
You must never talk to strangers.
Is that clear?

61
00:10:09,944 --> 00:10:17,118
Father.

62
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:32,467
<i>From now on, you're her father.
Look after her to the end.</i>

63
00:10:41,434 --> 00:10:43,645
<i>13 Years Later</i>

64
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:50,652
- Nam-Yi!
- She's coming your way.

65
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:52,529
Go after it.

66
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:54,989
I'm doing it.

67
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:57,992
Nam-Yi,

68
00:10:58,076 --> 00:11:00,161
she's going that way!

69
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:08,837
You missed.

70
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:31,109
It's hit.

71
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:33,444
He got her!

72
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:35,613
He got her.

73
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,995
Over there.

74
00:11:45,164 --> 00:11:46,416
Wait!

75
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:47,709
What's the matter?

76
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:48,835
Where are we?

77
00:11:48,918 --> 00:11:50,169
What do you mean?

78
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,014
These are markings for tiger traps.

79
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:05,852
Let's get out of here.

80
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:12,901
Wait.

81
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,324
Did you hear that?

82
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:20,533
I sure did.

83
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:30,293
- Tiger!
- It's a tiger.

84
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:33,421
- Tiger!
- Run, it's a tiger.

85
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:34,547
Tiger!

86
00:12:34,631 --> 00:12:36,799
Run! It's a tiger.

87
00:12:36,883 --> 00:12:38,551
Tiger.

88
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,636
It's a tiger.

89
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:41,471
Tiger!

90
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:46,142
<i>Tiger! Oh, tiger!
Good tiger of Mt. Songak</i>

91
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:51,064
<i>Where is my dear one?
My darling as soft as feathers</i>

92
00:12:52,231 --> 00:12:58,112
The other day, I went to the
so-called Songak's finest joy house.

93
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:00,782
Didn't quite live up to its reputation.

94
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:02,075
No?

95
00:13:02,158 --> 00:13:08,998
Miss Ja-In is the fairest in all of Songak.

96
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:14,420
She'd have eligible bachelors
line up for miles, if only...

97
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:17,966
Cut the crap and have a drink.

98
00:13:20,093 --> 00:13:24,681
Lady Kim is just being unfair.

99
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:28,601
Miss Ja-In is more than
a good match for her son.

100
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:32,563
Take her elegant demeanour for instance.

101
00:13:32,647 --> 00:13:39,612
On top of that, she has outstanding beauty.

102
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:42,407
The young master has nothing
to offer in comparison.

103
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:45,201
- You're right.
- I said cut it out!

104
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:54,168
What's his problem?

105
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:56,838
That's enough.
You know the circumstances.

106
00:13:56,921 --> 00:14:01,467
I know so well.
I was speaking out of frustration.

107
00:14:01,551 --> 00:14:03,011
Shut your trap!

108
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:06,639
Moron!

109
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:11,227
I was speaking on your behalf.

110
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:13,730
You called me a name, didn't you?

111
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:17,859
Think you're better than me
for speaking the savage's language?

112
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:23,531
I'll rip his mouth apart.
Teach him a lesson!

113
00:14:25,575 --> 00:14:27,535
Calm down, man.

114
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:34,375
- Get off me.
- Please, sir.

115
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:35,752
I'll kill you.

116
00:14:41,215 --> 00:14:43,342
You insufferable troll!

117
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,144
Knock it off, both of you.

118
00:14:56,355 --> 00:15:00,526
I thought I would drop by for a drink.

119
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:04,280
Good evening, sir.

120
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:12,330
Does fighting help arouse the appetite?

121
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:16,667
What was the brawl about?

122
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,797
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

123
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,594
Come and have a drink.

124
00:15:31,474 --> 00:15:36,562
I trust you could use a change of scenery.

125
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,190
Let's go someplace decent.

126
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:45,905
A good boy like you knows
a decent place for a drink?

127
00:15:47,281 --> 00:15:50,785
You'll see.

128
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:23,401
A hell of a spirit for a joy house.

129
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:29,740
This place is famous for its fine drink.

130
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:33,369
Indeed, it's rather refreshing.

131
00:16:47,383 --> 00:16:49,468
Wait.

132
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:53,014
Allow me.

133
00:16:53,097 --> 00:16:54,557
What do you want?

134
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,686
I would like to pour you a drink, brother.

135
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:01,939
- Brother'?
- Please.

136
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,614
At last, you're treating me
with some respect.

137
00:17:13,034 --> 00:17:17,914
I hoped to discuss
a matter of grave importance.

138
00:17:22,543 --> 00:17:25,546
I would like to make an
offer for Miss Ja-In.

139
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:30,509
What?

140
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:37,516
As her guardian, please accept my offer.

141
00:17:43,773 --> 00:17:47,818
Does Lady Kim know of this?
What about the master?

142
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:56,118
I can persuade them. I'm dead serious.

143
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:10,591
Please say yes,

144
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:15,596
for the sake of our friendship.
Aren't we closer than anyone?

145
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:18,140
Says who'?

146
00:18:18,891 --> 00:18:21,310
Says I.

147
00:18:21,394 --> 00:18:25,273
Have you lost your mind?

148
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:27,066
We're family.

149
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,530
Besides, you're talking about
marrying a traitor's daughter.

150
00:18:35,324 --> 00:18:42,164
- Are you hoping to ruin your life'?
- I know what concerns you.

151
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:47,169
I assure you, I'll persuade my mother.

152
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:51,549
We've lived under the same roof
for so many years.

153
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,760
The years she had to endure...

154
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:58,347
caring for traitor's children
she never wanted!

155
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,602
Will you burden her for
the rest of her life?

156
00:19:03,686 --> 00:19:04,895
- But Nam-Yi...
- Also!

157
00:19:04,979 --> 00:19:08,523
Think about Ja-In with
such an unhappy mother-in-law.

158
00:19:08,524 --> 00:19:13,070
My mind is set no matter what you say.

159
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:18,200
I'm prepared to do anything for her.

160
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,329
Anything?

161
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:30,671
Fine. Here is my condition.

162
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:31,881
Condition?

163
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:37,345
- What condition?
- Hey!

164
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:45,019
If you cut me, I'll give you my blessing.

165
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:47,897
But if you fail,

166
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:52,568
I shall take my sister
and leave town tonight.

167
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,071
Is that clear?

168
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:59,116
I don't know what you're trying...

169
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,416
Hey!

170
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,380
Look at you, pretty boy! Weak as a kitten.

171
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:17,009
I'm the son of a military official.
I'm going easy on you.

172
00:20:18,344 --> 00:20:22,848
I'll never give her to a sissy like you.

173
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,728
I would rather have her marry a butcher.

174
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,730
A butcher would be good.

175
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,425
That's enough. If you'll excuse me.

176
00:20:57,925 --> 00:20:59,969
We're not done.

177
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,250
Sit down.

178
00:21:33,294 --> 00:21:37,381
Mindless drinking and brawling.
Life is a fun game for you?

179
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,763
Yes, sir. I have no worries at heart.
The world seems like rat shit to me.

180
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,893
It's been 13 years
since you came to this house.

181
00:21:48,976 --> 00:21:51,645
You have abandoned
your studies and training.

182
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:55,441
You're idling away your days.

183
00:21:56,525 --> 00:22:03,532
Could I serve in the court
or defend the country?

184
00:22:03,616 --> 00:22:05,159
I'm the son of a traitor.

185
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:17,838
- I'll just live today and drop dead tomorrow.
- Enough!

186
00:22:17,922 --> 00:22:22,760
- Your father was the king's loyal servant.
- I am well aware of that.

187
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:24,720
- And yet...
- And yet!

188
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:30,392
I saw clearly how a loyal
servant is valued!

189
00:22:33,729 --> 00:22:40,486
What's the point?
You're all doomed to the same destiny.

190
00:22:40,569 --> 00:22:43,739
Isn't that why you're holed up
in the countryside?

191
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:46,075
How dare you!

192
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,749
If there is nothing more,

193
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:57,002
I'll get some more drink before I sober up.

194
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:01,382
Did you know...

195
00:23:03,092 --> 00:23:07,303
that I gave your sister her name?

196
00:23:07,304 --> 00:23:11,600
And your father named my son.

197
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:16,272
I'm giving my permission
for the marriage to Ja-In.

198
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:59,189
<i>The bow hand should be strong like
the great mountain and fast like the tiger.</i>

199
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:03,360
<i>Hold it up like a mountain.</i>

200
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:05,863
<i>Pull it curled up like the tail of a tiger.</i>

201
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:12,805
You should use your elbow
rather than the wrist.

202
00:25:20,479 --> 00:25:23,315
What are you doing out so late?

203
00:25:25,526 --> 00:25:27,569
You shouldn't be here.

204
00:25:29,905 --> 00:25:32,741
Why did you do it?

205
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:34,993
What do you mean?

206
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,710
Forget about the wedding. It's all in vain.

207
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:46,839
Unless the king is deposed
or the country falls,

208
00:25:46,922 --> 00:25:50,342
there is no hope
for the traitor's descendants.

209
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:56,181
You'll only end up hurt.

210
00:25:58,684 --> 00:26:00,686
You're always like this.

211
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:07,067
Why did you run? Only to live like this?

212
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:10,320
We should have died together
there and then.

213
00:26:13,282 --> 00:26:20,164
Coward! At least I won't live like you.

214
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:35,012
You'll marry him without my blessing?

215
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,183
<i>Marriage
The root of all happiness</i>

216
00:27:28,065 --> 00:27:29,233
This way.

217
00:27:29,983 --> 00:27:31,610
Thank you for coming.

218
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:33,380
What are you doing here?
You should be at your seat.

219
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:58,340
Bride, bow twice.

220
00:30:07,265 --> 00:30:12,437
Groom, bow once.

221
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,858
- Sir, your turn.
- Come on.

222
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:33,000
- Are you all right, sir?
- Will he make it through the wedding night?

223
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:38,857
Bride, bow twice.

224
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:41,276
- Look at him smile.
- Shush.

225
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:40,418
Get into position!

226
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:44,047
Close the gates! Close the gates!

227
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:47,050
Get into formation!

228
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:05,921
We're under attack!

229
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:52,676
<i>1636 A.D.
Second Manchu Invasion of Korea</i>

230
00:35:11,403 --> 00:35:13,113
What's going on?

231
00:35:23,248 --> 00:35:25,875
Run away! Run!

232
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:40,390
My lady!

233
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,329
Gang-Du!

234
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,248
Gang-Du!

235
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:33,169
Protect the prince.

236
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,574
Ja-In!

237
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:05,076
Let her go!

238
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:14,419
My lady!

239
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,579
Savages!

240
00:39:18,024 --> 00:39:19,526
Highness!

241
00:39:19,609 --> 00:39:21,194
No!

242
00:40:11,411 --> 00:40:12,912
Father.

243
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,708
Ja-In.

244
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:18,876
No!

245
00:41:45,588 --> 00:41:47,632
Where are they taking us?

246
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:48,841
Keep walking.

247
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:03,189
Keep walking.

248
00:42:11,406 --> 00:42:12,532
Keep walking.

249
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,933
This is war.

250
00:42:39,016 --> 00:42:43,312
Don't feel sorrow, dear cousin.

251
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:49,318
He broke Mangudai siege with his bow.

252
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:53,905
I never saw a Joseon man shoot like him.

253
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:57,076
We didn't have a full
unit for encirclement.

254
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,955
I thought their bows were weak.

255
00:43:01,038 --> 00:43:05,084
Their bows come
from the same root as ours.

256
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:08,963
Shorter and thinner
but with good range and mobility.

257
00:43:13,009 --> 00:43:16,345
We must not underestimate them.

258
00:43:18,723 --> 00:43:20,475
Jiusinta! Wanhan!

259
00:43:20,558 --> 00:43:23,686
The captives exceed our number.
I salute you, my uncles.

260
00:43:25,772 --> 00:43:27,356
Have a safe trip, Your Highness.

261
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,776
They're ready for you.

262
00:43:38,618 --> 00:43:42,872
Hurry back. We have a lot to do.

263
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:49,587
Long live Manchuria.

264
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:52,715
Long live Manchuria.

265
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:57,720
Commander, we're ready to go.

266
00:43:58,262 --> 00:44:01,474
- Fuman, take care of His Highness.
- Yes, Commander.

267
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,267
Our fallen brothers as well.

268
00:44:03,351 --> 00:44:04,435
Yes, sir.

269
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,823
Ja-In!

270
00:45:02,869 --> 00:45:03,911
Ja-In!

271
00:45:26,642 --> 00:45:27,768
Ja-In!

272
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,865
Ja-In!

273
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:33,811
<i>King Injo who took refuge

274
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:37,940

00:47:39,525 --> 00:47:43,154

00:47:44,989 --> 00:47:48,284
<i>men and women of

00:47:49,785 --> 00:47:52,955
<i>were taken to Manchuria

278
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:58,335
<i>Many died en route</i>

279
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:06,635
<i>of maltreatment and exhaustion.</i>

280
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:33,579
MY dear!

281
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:39,877
When can I see them?

282
00:48:40,961 --> 00:48:44,256
Who will look after my father's shrine now?

283
00:48:46,342 --> 00:48:47,843
Mother!

284
00:49:57,121 --> 00:49:58,747
Spare me.

285
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:04,336
Golden flag embroidered with
a blue dragon,

286
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,589
where is it?

287
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:09,300
Please.

288
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:11,427
I'll decide after you answer.

289
00:50:13,179 --> 00:50:18,726
They're headed north.

290
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:20,895
That's all I know.

291
00:50:52,968 --> 00:50:56,055
<i>The arrow penetrated the neck.
Death was instant.</i>

292
00:50:56,138 --> 00:50:58,182
<i>For all of them.</i>

293
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:06,357
We must hurry.
It could be the work of militia.

294
00:51:54,863 --> 00:51:56,740
Take this one.

295
00:52:07,293 --> 00:52:09,211
Please, no!

296
00:52:26,895 --> 00:52:29,356
Commander, you should see this.

297
00:52:42,703 --> 00:52:44,330
It happened in the blink of an eye.

298
00:52:46,123 --> 00:52:48,542
He was there one moment
and disappeared the next.

299
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:53,380
And arrows came flying in again.

300
00:52:53,464 --> 00:52:56,133
They came from an impossible angle.

301
00:53:01,972 --> 00:53:04,391
He speaks our language

302
00:53:04,475 --> 00:53:06,894
and is chasing the royal banner?

303
00:53:06,977 --> 00:53:09,104
That's what he said.

304
00:53:11,273 --> 00:53:13,484
Did he shoot red arrows?

305
00:53:16,236 --> 00:53:17,446
How did you know?

306
00:53:19,198 --> 00:53:20,991
I don't know who he is,

307
00:53:21,909 --> 00:53:24,078
but he is after the prince's troop.

308
00:53:25,537 --> 00:53:30,084
Then he said something puzzling.

309
00:53:31,627 --> 00:53:33,879
Why aren't you killing me?

310
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:40,552
My bow's purpose is not to kill.

311
00:53:43,389 --> 00:53:47,059
It wasn't his bow's purpose to kill.

312
00:53:54,233 --> 00:53:57,778
Abort the mission.
Nirus, follow me immediately.

313
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,310
Is this the last batch?

314
00:54:30,394 --> 00:54:31,854
That's right.

315
00:54:36,275 --> 00:54:41,405
Brothers, we're going home!

316
00:54:55,752 --> 00:54:58,422
Interpreter! Interpreter!

317
00:54:58,505 --> 00:55:01,425
Yes, sir.

318
00:55:07,181 --> 00:55:12,060
Listen carefully to what I say.

319
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:17,691
Once you cross this river, you'll never be
able to go back to your country.

320
00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:26,700
You all know that once you cross
this river, you'll be deemed a traitor.

321
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:31,872
- Those who want to run, I'm releasing you.
- Pardon me?

322
00:55:37,586 --> 00:55:38,795
Uh...

323
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,177
Well...

324
00:55:47,596 --> 00:55:49,348
OK, OK!

325
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:53,769
He says you can run if you want.

326
00:55:53,852 --> 00:55:55,103
Now is the time.

327
00:55:55,187 --> 00:55:59,733
This is your last chance.
Don't you miss your home?

328
00:56:01,068 --> 00:56:05,197
But you know you mustn't run
even if he says so.

329
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,116
I'll count to five.

330
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:11,203
Those who'll go home, go now.

331
00:56:11,286 --> 00:56:15,123
Sit tight for five counts.
Then you'll live!

332
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,377
One.

333
00:56:23,048 --> 00:56:24,216
Two.

334
00:56:29,471 --> 00:56:31,557
Three.

335
00:56:38,814 --> 00:56:40,899
<i>Four.</i>

336
00:56:41,817 --> 00:56:44,319
Your last chance.

337
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:47,114
- What's going on?
- Don't get agitated.

338
00:56:55,372 --> 00:56:59,418
- Eun-Yi!
- See you back home, Father.

339
00:56:59,501 --> 00:57:02,504
No, my child!

340
00:57:02,588 --> 00:57:04,631
Eun-Yi!

341
00:57:05,591 --> 00:57:07,175
Eun-Yi!

342
00:57:08,135 --> 00:57:10,178
People of Joseon,

343
00:57:10,262 --> 00:57:13,097
you can go back home whenever you wish.

344
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:18,687
Just never alive.

345
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,273
Get them!

346
00:57:29,406 --> 00:57:34,995
See'? It was an evil ploy to test us.

347
00:57:38,457 --> 00:57:40,042
This way.

348
00:57:54,306 --> 00:57:56,975
Wretched monsters!

349
00:58:01,772 --> 00:58:03,732
My child!

350
00:58:11,615 --> 00:58:13,075
Eun-Yi!

351
00:58:19,373 --> 00:58:21,500
- I shall stand up to them.
- Sir?

352
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:30,509
If even one of them can
make it back alive...

353
00:58:31,635 --> 00:58:34,429
Master! You'll get yourself killed.

354
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,240
What's happening?

355
00:59:35,323 --> 00:59:37,117
Come and get me!

356
00:59:38,118 --> 00:59:43,248
You'll have to get past me first.

357
00:59:45,125 --> 00:59:48,670
Have we no warriors among us?

358
01:01:16,675 --> 01:01:18,802
You!

359
01:01:18,885 --> 01:01:22,556
Crawl up to me like your king did.

360
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:26,351
If you don't, my arrow
will pierce your heart.

361
01:02:11,771 --> 01:02:13,273
Kill him!

362
01:02:37,672 --> 01:02:39,466
Damn it.

363
01:02:41,259 --> 01:02:43,511
What happened to lying low?

364
01:02:44,596 --> 01:02:46,431
Let's join them!

365
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,386
Let's go.

366
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,276
Freedom!

367
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,488
Freedom!

368
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:47,826
We're free.

369
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:53,415
Hurrah!

370
01:04:05,677 --> 01:04:06,720
Ja-In!

371
01:04:30,118 --> 01:04:33,538
<i>Don't blame me too harshly for losing her.</i>

372
01:04:33,621 --> 01:04:35,874
<i>Didn't I promise you?</i>

373
01:04:35,957 --> 01:04:39,377
<i>That I'll do anything for Ja-In.</i>

374
01:04:40,003 --> 01:04:43,882
<i>She'll be waiting for me,
enduring with fortitude.</i>

375
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:48,636
<i>Are you going to be OK?</i>

376
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:51,264
<i>Even if we have the enemy's map,</i>

377
01:04:51,347 --> 01:04:56,227
<i>anyone crossing the river
back home is deemed a traitor.</i>

378
01:04:58,438 --> 01:05:02,609
<i>The king who abandoned his people
is himself a great sinner.</i>

379
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,864
Clean her up.

380
01:06:07,423 --> 01:06:10,051
You brought a feisty one today.

381
01:06:12,846 --> 01:06:14,764
Forgive me, Your Highness.

382
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,036
Take off her clothes.

383
01:06:41,374 --> 01:06:43,626
I'm a married woman.

384
01:06:43,710 --> 01:06:46,379
Do not disgrace me.

385
01:06:46,462 --> 01:06:48,548
Stop.

386
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:56,806
When did you learn our language?

387
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:01,519
I learned it from my father
who served at the northern border.

388
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:05,148
Then you must know about
the greatness of Qing China.

389
01:07:06,149 --> 01:07:08,693
Don't put me to this shame. I beg of you.

390
01:07:08,776 --> 01:07:10,570
Even your king swore allegiance.

391
01:07:10,653 --> 01:07:13,865
How can you consider this shameful?

392
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:19,621
How can you consider yourself
to be an honourable man

393
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:22,248
if you persecute your prisoners?

394
01:07:43,102 --> 01:07:45,772
Do you see this? It's tiger hide.

395
01:07:45,855 --> 01:07:49,192
My courageous uncle Jiusinta
gave it to me as a present.

396
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:54,030
It protects me from the cold and heat
and rain, even fire.

397
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:57,242
This soft hide was stiff at first...

398
01:08:00,912 --> 01:08:04,415
until it was properly tanned.

399
01:08:06,376 --> 01:08:09,420
The process of tanning a hide
can be quite fun.

400
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:22,350
Have her stand outside
until she begs for her life.

401
01:09:02,974 --> 01:09:04,934
Only the strategy map is missing.

402
01:09:30,710 --> 01:09:33,254
We must track him down at once.

403
01:09:33,338 --> 01:09:37,508
The bodies of our brothers shall be
taken care of by the rearguard units.

404
01:09:37,592 --> 01:09:39,844
Yes, Commander.

405
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,369
This is it.

406
01:10:08,414 --> 01:10:10,458
Insufferable savages!

407
01:10:24,764 --> 01:10:26,599
Is that Miss Ja-In?

408
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:32,730
Wait till sunset.

409
01:10:32,814 --> 01:10:36,109
What difference will that make?

410
01:10:37,318 --> 01:10:39,779
Can't just go without a plan.

411
01:10:39,862 --> 01:10:44,200
Look at their numbers.

412
01:10:44,283 --> 01:10:48,121
We'll take the leader as hostage
and exchange him for Ja-In.

413
01:10:48,204 --> 01:10:50,415
- That's the only way.
- Is it going to work?

414
01:10:50,498 --> 01:10:52,792
What about an exit strategy?

415
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:59,173
After we get Ja-In, we'll cross the river
and meet back at this hut.

416
01:10:59,257 --> 01:11:02,260
By tomorrow noon.

417
01:11:02,343 --> 01:11:03,386
OK.

418
01:11:03,469 --> 01:11:04,804
But, Nam-Yi,

419
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:08,182
we have no plans for
how we'll catch their leader.

420
01:11:08,266 --> 01:11:09,684
- Gang-Du!
- Yeah?

421
01:11:09,767 --> 01:11:11,727
There is something I want you to do.

422
01:11:11,811 --> 01:11:13,896
What is it?

423
01:11:21,988 --> 01:11:25,408
How insipid! This is no fun.

424
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:29,328
Your men have no backbones
and women have no fidelity.

425
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:35,585
I'm curious.

426
01:11:35,668 --> 01:11:38,713
What broke you down so quickly?

427
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:41,382
Was it thirst or hunger?

428
01:11:41,466 --> 01:11:43,843
Or despair?

429
01:11:45,094 --> 01:11:47,680
My father the Khan once told me,

430
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:50,850
men and animals alike,
the best way to control them is food.

431
01:11:50,933 --> 01:11:53,144
Looking at you, I see he was right.

432
01:11:54,604 --> 01:11:58,274
My father once told me,
one's vision is clouded when one is hungry.

433
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:01,903
So, one must always fill
the stomach before a fight.

434
01:12:02,904 --> 01:12:05,823
Are you saying you're a warrior?

435
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,118
I'm a Warrior's daughter.

436
01:12:09,202 --> 01:12:11,746
I shall not beg for my life,

437
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:13,915
nor shall I die in vain.

438
01:12:24,091 --> 01:12:25,384
Damn!

439
01:12:25,468 --> 01:12:27,136
Impudent bitch!

440
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:29,347
Yeah, that's more like it.

441
01:12:43,819 --> 01:12:44,987
Go on, try again.

442
01:12:45,071 --> 01:12:47,156
Don't give up.

443
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:52,995
What's going on?

444
01:12:53,079 --> 01:12:54,830
The prisoners are getting away!

445
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,627
Your Highness!

446
01:13:01,587 --> 01:13:04,215
Do not interfere!
Anyone who disobeys shall be killed!

447
01:13:06,008 --> 01:13:07,677
- Leave us!
- But, Your Highness...

448
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,388
They're over there!

449
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:15,017
This way! Come on.

450
01:13:15,101 --> 01:13:16,394
Follow them.

451
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:25,278
Who the hell are you?

452
01:13:25,361 --> 01:13:26,737
Long live Manchu!

453
01:13:26,821 --> 01:13:28,322
- Manchu?
- Manchu.

454
01:13:28,406 --> 01:13:30,491
Yes, Manchu. Manchu, Manchu.

455
01:13:30,575 --> 01:13:31,951
Tza-it!

456
01:13:32,034 --> 01:13:33,369
What?

457
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:38,874
I see now

458
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:42,295
how stubborn and stupid
Joseon's women are.

459
01:13:52,722 --> 01:13:55,891
That skewer is all you depend on.

460
01:14:07,028 --> 01:14:08,487
The strategy worked.

461
01:14:08,571 --> 01:14:12,158
Let's get out of here.

462
01:14:12,241 --> 01:14:14,076
Can you take it from here?

463
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,202
But, Master...

464
01:14:15,286 --> 01:14:17,913
Master! Master!

465
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:19,165
It's them!

466
01:14:19,248 --> 01:14:21,459
- Get those two first.
- Let's go.

467
01:14:30,885 --> 01:14:33,054
Who the hell are you?

468
01:14:46,901 --> 01:14:48,444
Are you hurt?

469
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:50,488
Nam-vi!

470
01:14:51,947 --> 01:14:54,533
I'm sorry it took so long.

471
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,173
Release the prince.

472
01:15:10,132 --> 01:15:11,926
Or I'll kill her.

473
01:15:21,686 --> 01:15:23,187
My lady!

474
01:15:26,524 --> 01:15:28,275
Who are you people?

475
01:15:36,033 --> 01:15:37,785
What are you doing?

476
01:15:56,011 --> 01:15:58,013
- Your Highness!
- No!

477
01:15:58,097 --> 01:15:59,473
Step back.

478
01:15:59,557 --> 01:16:00,850
Nobody move.

479
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:02,601
Shoot him!

480
01:16:04,395 --> 01:16:05,478
Hold your bows.

481
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:07,732
- Go now.
- What about you?

482
01:16:09,316 --> 01:16:11,026
Remember what I said?

483
01:16:11,110 --> 01:16:13,487
I'll meet you at the hut tomorrow noon.

484
01:16:13,571 --> 01:16:15,322
We'll be waiting.

485
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:18,409
No! You're coming with us!

486
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:20,494
You want us to die here?

487
01:16:23,289 --> 01:16:27,042
We leave together or we die here together.

488
01:16:27,126 --> 01:16:29,170
Don't tell me to leave you like this!

489
01:16:35,384 --> 01:16:39,305
My lady, we cannot all go together.

490
01:16:39,388 --> 01:16:42,767
Wait for me. I promise I'll see you again.

491
01:16:58,324 --> 01:17:01,577
You hope to live after what you have done?

492
01:17:03,996 --> 01:17:07,541
I wouldn't have done it
if I was worried about living.

493
01:17:27,853 --> 01:17:32,274
Are you afraid now that
your time is almost up?

494
01:17:32,358 --> 01:17:37,988
The firewood has almost burned out.

495
01:17:45,788 --> 01:17:47,706
Thank you

496
01:17:47,790 --> 01:17:49,458
for holding up so long.

497
01:18:56,025 --> 01:18:58,027
Where is His Highness?

498
01:19:05,701 --> 01:19:07,953
He was assassinated.

499
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:20,174
Please.

500
01:19:28,349 --> 01:19:30,517
Commander, he went in that direction.

501
01:19:30,601 --> 01:19:32,561
Our men went after him.

502
01:20:06,053 --> 01:20:10,015
Nam-Yi! It's great to see you again.

503
01:20:14,228 --> 01:20:15,479
You made it.

504
01:20:16,397 --> 01:20:19,400
What about Miss Ja-In?
And the young master?

505
01:20:19,483 --> 01:20:22,152
- They should be ahead of us.
- How fortunate!

506
01:20:22,236 --> 01:20:24,613
We must try to catch up.

507
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,618
- They must be going after them, too.
- Gang-Du, take these.

508
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,843
What the hell?

509
01:20:45,926 --> 01:20:49,096
Now it's reds instead of the blues?

510
01:20:55,102 --> 01:20:56,520
It's the half-pounder.

511
01:20:56,603 --> 01:20:57,771
What?

512
01:20:57,855 --> 01:20:59,615
The arrowhead alone
weighs over half a pound.

513
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:03,027
It's more powerful than
a mechanical crossbow.

514
01:21:03,318 --> 01:21:05,779
We must go into the woods.

515
01:21:19,877 --> 01:21:22,629
Get into siege formation!

516
01:22:12,513 --> 01:22:14,431
That doesn't look right. Let's go this way.

517
01:22:14,515 --> 01:22:17,518
- We must cut through here.
- Come on, we have to move on.

518
01:22:17,601 --> 01:22:19,811
Nam-Yi, I think he's right.

519
01:22:19,812 --> 01:22:20,979
- Let's go.
- Come on.

520
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:29,113
The path ends there. We've got them.

521
01:22:29,196 --> 01:22:33,450
We must capture him alive.
He will suffer to his last breath.

522
01:22:42,376 --> 01:22:44,211
Come on, hurry.

523
01:22:46,672 --> 01:22:47,798
Gang-Du!

524
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:00,894
Look out!

525
01:23:05,107 --> 01:23:06,191
We must hurry.

526
01:23:09,820 --> 01:23:12,698
Gang-Du! Gang-Du!

527
01:23:13,949 --> 01:23:14,992
Gang-Du!

528
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:17,828
It's a miracle I got this far. Leave me.

529
01:23:17,911 --> 01:23:19,163
Gang-Du.

530
01:23:20,414 --> 01:23:22,374
Gang-Du!

531
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:27,629
- Go! I'll hold them off as long as I can.
- Gang-Du!

532
01:23:27,713 --> 01:23:29,047
Go on!

533
01:23:29,131 --> 01:23:31,175
Gang-Du, no!

534
01:23:31,258 --> 01:23:32,426
Get going-

535
01:23:32,509 --> 01:23:33,760
Gang-Du!

536
01:23:47,357 --> 01:23:49,359
Cut the net!

537
01:23:49,443 --> 01:23:51,111
I can't move.

538
01:23:57,743 --> 01:23:59,161
Help them.

539
01:24:08,962 --> 01:24:11,965
The marking for tiger traps...

540
01:24:14,635 --> 01:24:16,261
it's the same here.

541
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,638
I can't go any further.
I'm too old for this.

542
01:24:59,721 --> 01:25:01,181
Gab-Yong!

543
01:25:06,353 --> 01:25:07,396
Gab-Yong!

544
01:25:07,479 --> 01:25:09,064
Go on!

545
01:25:09,147 --> 01:25:13,235
Take care of Miss Ja-In and the master.

546
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:57,946
I'm taking one of you with me.

547
01:26:41,531 --> 01:26:42,699
Shoot!

548
01:26:54,544 --> 01:26:56,171
It's him.

549
01:26:56,254 --> 01:26:58,882
He is still alive.

550
01:27:05,639 --> 01:27:06,973
We'll cross.

551
01:27:11,770 --> 01:27:13,313
Adai!

552
01:27:20,821 --> 01:27:22,072
Naigada!

553
01:28:25,969 --> 01:28:27,012
Let's cross.

554
01:28:47,532 --> 01:28:48,783
Adai!

555
01:28:48,867 --> 01:28:49,993
Come on!

556
01:29:03,507 --> 01:29:04,549
Adai!

557
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:23,318
Wanhan!

558
01:29:24,694 --> 01:29:25,820
Hurry.

559
01:29:27,322 --> 01:29:29,449
Let me go.

560
01:29:29,533 --> 01:29:31,159
Get him for me.

561
01:29:31,243 --> 01:29:32,744
Don't give up.

562
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:51,471
Commander!

563
01:29:57,769 --> 01:30:01,815
Come on.

564
01:30:21,251 --> 01:30:23,503
We're falling behind.
We must pick up the pace.

565
01:30:34,055 --> 01:30:36,266
- I'll do it.
- Let me.

566
01:30:50,864 --> 01:30:52,073
You have blisters.

567
01:30:58,705 --> 01:31:03,918
They say if you cross back
to Joseon, you'll be punished.

568
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:08,882
They won't do that to
their fellow countrymen.

569
01:31:10,634 --> 01:31:13,595
It's probably to stop
people from crossing over.

570
01:31:16,097 --> 01:31:17,474
Sir...

571
01:31:20,310 --> 01:31:23,813
I'll hang on to that.

572
01:31:34,699 --> 01:31:39,829
I'll get some drinking water.

573
01:32:19,119 --> 01:32:20,578
Get back inside.

574
01:32:33,216 --> 01:32:34,342
Ja-In!

575
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:37,220
My eye!

576
01:32:53,903 --> 01:32:55,739
Ja-In!

577
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:22,909
Chase him!

578
01:35:04,033 --> 01:35:05,368
Got him.

579
01:35:05,451 --> 01:35:06,494
Keep chasing.

580
01:36:04,886 --> 01:36:06,220
He turned back.

581
01:37:26,718 --> 01:37:28,428
Let me ask you a question.

582
01:37:28,511 --> 01:37:33,307
Why didn't you shoot me at the cliff?

583
01:37:36,352 --> 01:37:41,107
Was it to bring me into contempt?

584
01:37:43,651 --> 01:37:49,407
He shall suffer to his last breath.
Cut off his limbs.

585
01:38:09,510 --> 01:38:10,720
Look out!

586
01:39:25,545 --> 01:39:26,629
Which way?

587
01:39:27,088 --> 01:39:28,131
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

588
01:39:29,423 --> 01:39:33,469
<i>But there is only one way.</i>

589
01:39:33,553 --> 01:39:35,513
Just one way?

590
01:39:35,596 --> 01:39:39,016
The river border is close. We'll catch up.

591
01:39:47,441 --> 01:39:48,568
Hurahu!

592
01:39:55,658 --> 01:39:57,618
Come to your senses!

593
01:39:59,579 --> 01:40:01,539
I feel something ominous in the air.

594
01:40:06,169 --> 01:40:08,254
Are you not a son of Manchuria?

595
01:40:09,463 --> 01:40:14,093
Hurahu shall take the lead.

596
01:41:54,026 --> 01:41:55,111
One.

597
01:42:02,868 --> 01:42:04,245
Two.

598
01:42:18,217 --> 01:42:19,302
Three.

599
01:42:39,322 --> 01:42:40,823
<i>Four.</i>

600
01:43:37,838 --> 01:43:39,215
It's the short arrow.

601
01:43:40,549 --> 01:43:44,428
<i>The same sniper arrows
we saw at the battle at the fortress?</i>

602
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:48,015
<i>But it has a jagged tip.</i>

603
01:43:48,724 --> 01:43:50,017
There is no arrowhead.

604
01:43:50,101 --> 01:43:52,520
He made it from a regular arrow.

605
01:43:54,105 --> 01:43:57,316
It makes no difference to us.

606
01:44:07,868 --> 01:44:10,121
My brother!

607
01:44:10,871 --> 01:44:11,997
Hurahu!

608
01:44:17,169 --> 01:44:18,546
Don't come this way!

609
01:44:19,880 --> 01:44:20,923
Stop!

610
01:47:54,928 --> 01:47:56,055
Ja-In!

611
01:49:12,798 --> 01:49:13,882
My lady!

612
01:49:17,803 --> 01:49:18,971
Nam-vi!

613
01:50:19,156 --> 01:50:20,199
My darling!

614
01:51:44,700 --> 01:51:48,537
All this trouble,

615
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,080
to save her?

616
01:52:07,306 --> 01:52:09,725
Are you calculating for the wind?

617
01:52:11,560 --> 01:52:14,354
But I've already seen your arrow.

618
01:52:14,438 --> 01:52:16,857
There is no point in
calculating for the wind.

619
01:52:48,263 --> 01:52:50,182
Did you fear for your girl?

620
01:52:51,767 --> 01:52:54,895
You may know how to shoot
curved arrows...

621
01:52:55,729 --> 01:53:01,026
but it's your fear that got
you and your girl killed.

622
01:53:01,109 --> 01:53:07,532
Now it's your turn to feel the pain

623
01:53:07,616 --> 01:53:09,201
of watching your loved one die.

624
01:53:14,122 --> 01:53:15,707
No, Nam-Yi!

625
01:53:15,791 --> 01:53:18,919
You'll die if you pull out that arrow.

626
01:53:26,093 --> 01:53:27,469
You lost.

627
01:53:29,888 --> 01:53:33,183
Nam-Yi, no!

628
01:53:48,699 --> 01:53:51,576
Now you'll sacrifice her?

629
01:54:10,178 --> 01:54:13,932
Even the wind isn't on your side.

630
01:54:52,095 --> 01:54:56,433
<i>Fear, you simply face it head-on.</i>

631
01:55:02,064 --> 01:55:08,445
<i>The wind is not to be calculated
but to be overcome.</i>

632
01:55:15,035 --> 01:55:19,164
You.

633
01:55:42,312 --> 01:55:43,897
Nam-Yi.

634
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:00,372
I have the other one here.

635
01:56:01,206 --> 01:56:06,253
- You knew they were from me.
- Of course I did. They were so big.

636
01:56:07,254 --> 01:56:10,215
Only you could get it so wrong.

637
01:56:11,925 --> 01:56:14,928
They were too big for you?

638
01:56:16,054 --> 01:56:21,101
I thought you were all grown up.
Maybe not so much.

639
01:56:25,063 --> 01:56:26,106
Ja-In,

640
01:56:27,816 --> 01:56:33,405
let's go back to our home in Seoul.

641
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:42,497
We'll go home. Wear pretty silk shoes.

642
01:57:36,635 --> 01:57:38,094
Look.

643
01:57:46,686 --> 01:57:50,148
It's our land that we must go back to.

644
01:58:17,175 --> 01:58:19,177
<i>Following the invasion,</i>

645
01:58:22,389 --> 01:58:25,183
<i>there was no repatriation effort
on Joseon's part.</i>

646
01:58:25,267 --> 01:58:28,353
<i>Only a handful of people
found their way back on their own.</i>
